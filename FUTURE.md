NatLangChain — Future Features Roadmap
This repository is the core ledger for a prose-first, intent-native blockchain.
“Post intent. Let the system find alignment.”
The protocol is deliberately neutral infrastructure — not an app, not a marketplace, not a social platform. The features below extend its capability as a permanent, mediated, auditable record of explicit human intent.
Short-Term (Q1–Q2 2026)

Multi-Chain Branching & Merging (in progress)
Git-like chains: personal, family, project, speculation, services, etc. Fork from any block, merge with LLM-mediated conflict resolution.
Self-Seeking Live Contracts
Contracts written in natural language automatically discover counterparts. LLM miners propose alignments, negotiate terms, and close deals.
Facilitation Incentives
Successful mediation earns a small, contract-specified percentage (paid via referenced off-chain escrow).
Lawful Use Integrity Checks
Procedural validation ensures intent is explicit, voluntary, and suitable for permanent public record. Ambiguous or unsafe prose is refused mediation — no censorship, no profiling.
Optional Third-Party Attestations
Users may reference (but never upload) identity, credentials, or background proofs via hashes.

Medium-Term (Q3 2026 – Q1 2027)

Daily Work Output Automation
Integration with memory-vault and IntentLog:
End-of-day summary automatically generated.
Standardized prose contract posted to dailyworkmarket chain.
Auction/banking logic encoded in the contract itself (highest bid, reserve banking, bundling, escalators).
Overnight mediation → payout or compounding.

Agent-Driven Participation
AI agents (via Agent-OS ecosystem) autonomously post, bid, counter, and close on behalf of users according to standing intent templates.
Chain Subscription & Selective Sync
Nodes subscribe only to relevant chains, reducing bandwidth while preserving global discoverability of public intents.
Semantic Narrative Views
Dynamic, readable renderings of chains: timelines, thread views, alignment graphs, receipt exports.

Long-Term (2027+)

Fully Decentralized Mediation Network
No central node required. Any participant can run an LLM mediator/miner. Consensus on closures via multi-model dialectic voting.
Bundled Vault Offerings
Banked daily outputs automatically compound into weekly/monthly/quarterly packages with escalating reserves.
Cross-Chain Intent Routing
Intents posted in private/personal chains can opt-in to public marketplace discovery without full exposure.
Escrow & Oracle References
Standardized prose patterns for referencing on-chain (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) escrows, HTLCs, and oracle feeds.
Reputation via Receipt Aggregation
Optional derived chains that summarize fulfillment history across closed contracts (no scoring, only verifiable receipts).

Non-Goals / Boundaries
NatLangChain will never:

Operate as a centralized app or marketplace
Store personal documents or private data
Perform surveillance, profiling, or reporting
Infer intent beyond what is explicitly written
Enforce legality or morality — only procedural clarity

How NatLangChain Eliminates the “First Contact” Barrier
With the automated intent labor network:

You sell at the door — no knocking required
Your daily work, GitHub commits, prototypes, or solutions are packaged as explicit prose contracts and posted publicly on the chain the moment they’re created.
No cover letter. No DM. No “hope they reply.”
Buyers discover you — you don’t chase them
Companies, DAOs, or agents post standing intents (“Need X, Y, Z — budget $10k”).
LLM mediators scan the chain overnight and proactively propose alignments:“Your Dec 18 output (multi-chain mediation refactor) matches Meta’s open intent for ethical AI negotiation layers — 92% fit. Proposed terms: $8k license.”
Negotiation happens in daylight, with receipts
All counters, acceptances, or rejections are public prose on-chain.
No awkward back-and-forth in private inboxes. No ghosting — silence is visible and contextual (e.g., “No counter received within 48 hours → auto-declined with receipt”).
Rejection loses its sting
A non-match isn’t personal — it’s just the system working. Your work remains on the market, compounding value until the right alignment emerges.
Fear evaporates because you’re not exposing your ego — you’re exposing your output.

The Result: A Fearless Labor Market

Junior devs can ship daily without begging for internships.
Indie makers can monetize side projects without marketing.
Big tech can tap global talent without sifting résumés or running expensive bounties.
Everyone benefits from reduced emotional friction — more deals close, faster, with full audit trails.

This isn’t just automation.
It’s psychological infrastructure.
By removing the terrifying “first outreach” step and replacing it with neutral, mediated alignment of explicit intent, NatLangChain makes professional relationships scalable, humane, and fearless.
You’re not just building a better marketplace.
You’re fixing the part of capitalism that hurts the most: the moment someone has to say, “Here’s my work — please see its value.”
And the chain says it for them, every single day.
That’s revolutionary.

The protocol remains substrate.
All “apps” (marketplaces, collaboration tools, creator economies) are emergent skins built on top of recorded, mediated, auditable intent.
Contributions welcome — especially around LLM mediation prompts, agent integrations, and decentralized sync.
