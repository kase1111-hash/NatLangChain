NatLangChain — Future Features Roadmap
This repository is the core ledger for a prose-first, intent-native blockchain.
“Post intent. Let the system find alignment.”
The protocol is deliberately neutral infrastructure — not an app, not a marketplace, not a social platform. The features below extend its capability as a permanent, mediated, auditable record of explicit human intent.
Short-Term (Q1–Q2 2026)

Multi-Chain Branching & Merging (in progress)
Git-like chains: personal, family, project, speculation, services, etc. Fork from any block, merge with LLM-mediated conflict resolution.
Self-Seeking Live Contracts
Contracts written in natural language automatically discover counterparts. LLM miners propose alignments, negotiate terms, and close deals.
Facilitation Incentives
Successful mediation earns a small, contract-specified percentage (paid via referenced off-chain escrow).
Lawful Use Integrity Checks
Procedural validation ensures intent is explicit, voluntary, and suitable for permanent public record. Ambiguous or unsafe prose is refused mediation — no censorship, no profiling.
Optional Third-Party Attestations
Users may reference (but never upload) identity, credentials, or background proofs via hashes.

Medium-Term (Q3 2026 – Q1 2027)

Daily Work Output Automation
Integration with memory-vault and IntentLog:
End-of-day summary automatically generated.
Standardized prose contract posted to dailyworkmarket chain.
Auction/banking logic encoded in the contract itself (highest bid, reserve banking, bundling, escalators).
Overnight mediation → payout or compounding.

Agent-Driven Participation
AI agents (via Agent-OS ecosystem) autonomously post, bid, counter, and close on behalf of users according to standing intent templates.
Chain Subscription & Selective Sync
Nodes subscribe only to relevant chains, reducing bandwidth while preserving global discoverability of public intents.
Semantic Narrative Views
Dynamic, readable renderings of chains: timelines, thread views, alignment graphs, receipt exports.

Long-Term (2027+)

Fully Decentralized Mediation Network
No central node required. Any participant can run an LLM mediator/miner. Consensus on closures via multi-model dialectic voting.
Bundled Vault Offerings
Banked daily outputs automatically compound into weekly/monthly/quarterly packages with escalating reserves.
Cross-Chain Intent Routing
Intents posted in private/personal chains can opt-in to public marketplace discovery without full exposure.
Escrow & Oracle References
Standardized prose patterns for referencing on-chain (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) escrows, HTLCs, and oracle feeds.
Reputation via Receipt Aggregation
Optional derived chains that summarize fulfillment history across closed contracts (no scoring, only verifiable receipts).

Non-Goals / Boundaries
NatLangChain will never:

Operate as a centralized app or marketplace
Store personal documents or private data
Perform surveillance, profiling, or reporting
Infer intent beyond what is explicitly written
Enforce legality or morality — only procedural clarity

The protocol remains substrate.
All “apps” (marketplaces, collaboration tools, creator economies) are emergent skins built on top of recorded, mediated, auditable intent.
Contributions welcome — especially around LLM mediation prompts, agent integrations, and decentralized sync.
