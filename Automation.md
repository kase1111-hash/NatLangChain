What We Do Automate
A Doctrine for NatLangChain

Status: Canonical Doctrine

Preamble

NatLangChain is not anti-automation.

It is selectively pro-automation — automating what expands human agency, legibility, and fairness, while refusing automation that collapses responsibility.

This doctrine defines the domains where automation is not only allowed, but essential.

1. We Automate Possibility Expansion

LLMs are used to expand what humans can see, consider, and articulate.

We automate:

Rephrasing for clarity, neutrality, or precision

Generation of alternative formulations of intent

Exploration of compromise language

Enumeration of plausible outcomes and trade-offs

Why: Humans negotiate better when more options are visible.

2. We Automate Consistency Checking

Machines are excellent at detecting internal mismatch.

We automate:

Detection of contradictions across statements

Identification of unstated assumptions

Flagging of ambiguous or overloaded language

Cross-referencing intent against prior records

Why: Inconsistency erodes trust long before malice appears.

3. We Automate Evidence Collection

Proof should be cheaper than doubt.

We automate:

Capture of work traces (code commits, transcripts, logs)

Time-stamping and hashing of effort artifacts

Linking effort to declared intent

Append-only receipt generation

Why: Effort that cannot be shown is effort that cannot be valued.

4. We Automate Provenance and Traceability

Every meaningful artifact should explain where it came from.

We automate:

Provenance tagging of model-generated text

Linking proposals to upstream intents

Dependency graphs across MPs

Reconstruction of decision paths

Why: Trust requires traceability, not promises.

5. We Automate Risk Surfacing (Not Risk Decisions)

The system may warn, but never decide.

We automate:

Highlighting likely failure modes

Surfacing potential disputes

Estimating alignment strength or uncertainty

Flagging missing prerequisites

Why: Forewarned humans make better choices.

6. We Automate Mediation Support (Not Judgment)

Machines may assist conversations without concluding them.

We automate:

Structuring claims and counterclaims

Summarizing positions neutrally

Suggesting clarification questions

Drafting provisional settlements

Why: Clarity is a service; judgment is a responsibility.

7. We Automate Interface Translation

Meaning must cross systems without distortion.

We automate:

Translation of natural-language settlements into structured interfaces

Generation of capitalization or licensing descriptors

Formatting records for external rails (blockchain, legal, accounting)

Why: Humans speak meaning; systems require structure.

8. We Automate Memory — Not Forgetting

The system remembers so humans don’t have to.

We automate:

Long-term retention of intents, efforts, and outcomes

Preservation of failed paths and abandoned negotiations

Immutable historical recording

Why: Institutional memory is a form of fairness.

9. The Shape of Automation in NatLangChain

Automation in NatLangChain is:

Assistive, not authoritative

Reversible in interpretation

Transparent in operation

Auditable in outcome

If automation ever removes a human’s ability to contest meaning, it has exceeded its mandate.

10. Canonical Doctrine

We automate everything that makes human intent clearer, safer, and more legible — and nothing that replaces human responsibility.
