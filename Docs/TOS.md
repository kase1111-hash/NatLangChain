Terms of Service

Effective Date: Draft — December 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of NatLangChain, a decentralized, prose-first intent ledger and associated reference implementations, interfaces, and services (collectively, the "System").

By accessing or using the System, you agree to these Terms.

1. What NatLangChain Is

NatLangChain is neutral infrastructure for recording, mediating, and aligning explicitly stated human intent expressed in natural language.

The primary data type is human-readable prose

Entries are voluntarily published by users

Large language models (LLMs) act as mediators to clarify intent and propose alignments

Every step of interaction is immutably recorded as readable narrative

The System records intent, not transactions, profiles, or surveillance data.

2. What NatLangChain Is Not

NatLangChain is not:

A dating app

A marketplace or classifieds site

An e-commerce platform

A financial exchange

A social network

A surveillance or monitoring service

Any such interfaces are external applications built on top of the protocol and are not part of the core System.

3. Lawful Use Only

You may use the System only for lawful, consensual purposes.

Even if legal in your jurisdiction, the following uses are explicitly prohibited on NatLangChain:

Gambling, wagering, betting, or games of chance involving value

Prostitution, escorting, or sexual services exchanged for compensation

Sale, solicitation, or distribution of illegal drugs or controlled substances

Human trafficking or facilitation thereof

Sale of weapons or explosives outside lawful, licensed contexts

Money laundering or attempts to disguise the source of funds

Explicitly fraudulent, deceptive, or coercive activity

These prohibitions apply regardless of local legality.

NatLangChain reserves the right to refuse mediation for prohibited uses.

4. Integrity Checks (Procedural, Not Enforcement)

Before an entry is accepted, the System may perform an integrity check to determine whether intent is:

Explicit and understandable

Suitable for permanent public record

Appropriate for mediation on this ledger

If intent is unclear, euphemistic, deliberately obscured, or unsafe, the System may decline to record or mediate it.

This is not a legal judgment or accusation. No report is made. No record is created.

5. No Surveillance, Monitoring, or Reporting

NatLangChain:

Does not monitor users

Does not track behavior across sessions or platforms

Does not profile or score users

Does not share private data with authorities or third parties

Does not conduct investigations or stings

The System only records what users explicitly and voluntarily publish.

6. Equal Treatment

All participants—individuals, companies, organizations, and public institutions—use the same mechanisms:

Same posting rules

Same mediation process

Same visibility

Same immutable receipts

No participant receives hidden privileges or backchannel access.

7. User Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

The accuracy and legality of what you publish

Ensuring you have the right to publish the content you submit

Understanding that entries are public and permanent

Do not post anything you would not consent to being recorded immutably.

8. Optional Third-Party Verification

The System may allow references to third-party attestations (e.g., identity verification, background checks).

Participation is optional

NatLangChain does not store personal documents

Only cryptographic or reference proofs may be recorded

Verification providers are independent third parties.

9. No Guarantees

NatLangChain does not guarantee:

That any match will occur

That any agreement will be reached

That counterparties will perform as promised

That off-chain enforcement will succeed

The System provides alignment and receipts, not outcomes.

10. Facilitation Fees

Some mediated alignments may specify facilitation fees for successful closure.

Fees are defined in prose by participants

Fees are claimed voluntarily

Payments occur off-chain or via referenced escrow

NatLangChain does not process payments.

11. Immutability and Forking

Entries published to the System are immutable.

Chains may fork, branch, or merge according to protocol rules, but original entries remain preserved as historical record.

12. Disclaimer of Liability

The System is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.

NatLangChain is not liable for:

User content

Failed negotiations

Disputes between participants

Off-chain actions or consequences

Use of the System is at your own risk.

13. Changes to These Terms

These Terms may evolve as the protocol develops.

Updated versions will be published publicly. Continued use constitutes acceptance of revised Terms.

14. Governing Principle

NatLangChain records intent. It does not watch people, judge them, or act on their behalf.

That boundary defines the System.
