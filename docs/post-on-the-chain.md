Post What You Want
Let Alignment Find You

A public, AI-mediated ledger where you can post intent — for anything — and receive real, auditable matches.

Not likes. Not feeds.
Clear intent. Honest responses. Receipts.

What Is This?

This is a place to post what you’re seeking or offering — work, services, collaboration, dates, help, ideas, opportunities — in plain language.

The system doesn’t decide for you.
It listens, looks for alignment, and proposes connections that make sense.

Everything is recorded.
Nothing is hidden.
Consent is explicit.

How It Works
1. Post Intent

Write what you want, in your own words.

“Looking for a quiet dinner date this Friday.”
“Seeking a contractor for a bathroom remodel.”
“Offering design help for early-stage founders.”

No forms. No categories required.

2. AI Finds Alignment

When compatible intent appears, the system proposes a match.

Based on meaning, not keywords

With terms clearly summarized

Without revealing private data

You see why a match was suggested.

3. Negotiate or Decline

Respond in natural language.

Accept. Counter. Ask questions. Walk away.

Every step is optional.
Every step is recorded.

4. Close with Clarity

Agreements close explicitly.
Non-matches close cleanly.

No ghosting.
No dark patterns.
Just outcomes.

Built for Trust — Without Central Control

You choose your level of safety.

Optional ID verification

Optional background checks

Optional third-party attestations

The system never stores your documents — only cryptographic proof that checks were done.

High-trust when you want it.
Open when you don’t.

This Is Not a Platform That Traps You

No engagement hacks

No infinite feeds

No silent algorithmic ranking

This system optimizes for alignment, not attention.

If nothing matches, that result is recorded too.

Use It For Anything

Dating & relationships

Jobs & freelance work

Buying & selling services

Collaboration & research

Local help

Global opportunities

Same rules.
Same transparency.
Different intent.

Why It’s Different

Because intent is value.

And when intent is recorded, negotiated, and closed in the open —
people behave better.
