You’re thinking in exactly the right direction. What you’re really designing here isn’t “tokenomics” in the abstract — it’s behavioral pressure shaping for a mediation layer. The question “what gives the most positive pressures?” is about which forces improve signal quality, system health, and long-term value without killing participation.

Let’s reason from first principles and then converge on a clean answer.

First: what “positive pressure” actually means here

In a mediating / intent-routing system like yours, positive pressure should:

Suppress noise faster than it suppresses signal

Reward deliberation, bundling, and seriousness

Scale automatically with demand and abuse

Tie value accrual to real coordination, not speculation

Fail gracefully under attack

Burns are not about revenue — they are entropy sinks. They turn excess activity into scarcity, which is exactly what spam is: excess entropy.

Evaluate your three mechanisms by pressure type
1. Burn-for-posting (filing fee)

Pressure created

Raises the floor cost of speech/action

Converts spam into value destruction (good)

Forces bots to internalize their externalities

What it’s best at

Deterring low-effort spam

Making contracts feel “serious” (legal filing analogy is apt)

Creating a psychological pause before posting

Limit

Flat fees don’t distinguish good faith power users from spammers

Alone, it can punish legitimate bursts of activity

Verdict

Necessary, but insufficient on its own.

Think of this as gravity — always on, gentle, unavoidable.

2. One free per day + exponential cost

This is a very strong positive-pressure tool.

Pressure created

Strongly encourages effort bundling

Forces prioritization

Penalizes compulsive or automated posting disproportionately

Why this is powerful

Humans naturally plan around daily resets

Exponentials kill spam fast while barely touching normal users

It aligns with cognition: “Is this worth my second slot today?”

Key insight
This mechanism doesn’t just reduce spam —
👉 it improves the average semantic density of posts.

People write better when posts are scarce.

Verdict

One of your highest signal-to-noise multipliers.

This is cognitive compression pressure.

3. Load-scaled burn (EIP-1559 style)

This is your systemic stabilizer.

Pressure created

Converts congestion into cost

Automatically defends the system during spikes

Aligns usage with available capacity

Why it’s essential

Prevents coordinated floods

Makes the system self-throttling

Turns popularity into deflation (a virtuous signal)

Crucially
This pressure is impersonal.
Users don’t feel “targeted” — they feel physics.

Verdict

This is your immune system.

Which combination gives the most positive pressure?

The strongest design is orthogonal pressure stacking — each mechanism attacking a different failure mode.

The winning stack
1. Daily free allowance (scarcity floor)

1 free intent / contract per 24h

Guarantees accessibility

Preserves legitimacy and fairness

2. Per-user exponential burn

2nd post: small burn

3rd: noticeable

4th+: punitive

Resets daily

➡ This kills spam locally and improves quality globally.

3. Global load-scaled burn

Multiplies all burns by a congestion factor

Quiet hours = cheap

Hot periods = expensive

➡ This protects the system structurally.

4. Small success burn (optional but elegant)

Tiny burn on successful mediation

Symbolic more than extractive

➡ This ties coordination success → scarcity → value.

Why this creates the best pressures (not just incentives)

This design creates four reinforcing loops:

Spam → cost → extinction

Thoughtfulness → bundling → clarity

Popularity → deflation → legitimacy

Success → value accrual → reuse

Importantly:

Spammers pay exponentially

Serious users pay rarely

Power users pay only when they choose to

The system adapts without governance intervention

That’s the hallmark of a well-shaped economy.

Subtle but important insight

Burning for posting is not just taxation — it’s semantic proof-of-work.

You’re not asking:

“Can you pay?”

You’re asking:

“Is this intent worth destroying value to assert?”

That single question filters noise better than almost any moderation system.

Final answer (directly to your question)

What gives the most positive pressures?

Exponential per-user costs + load-scaled burns, anchored by a free daily allowance, give the strongest positive pressure because they:

Improve content quality

Suppress abuse asymmetrically

Scale automatically

Tie value to coordination

Feel fair, not punitive
