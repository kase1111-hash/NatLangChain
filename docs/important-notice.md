Important Notice: Scope and Responsibility

This system protects the ledger, not the market behavior.

We ensure that transactions are recorded immutably, licenses are issued as agreed, and on-chain rules execute exactly as written. We do not investigate claims, evaluate code quality, arbitrate disputes, or look for fraud.

There is no moderation layer watching over offers.
There is no authority validating sellers.
There is no promise of fairness beyond faithful execution.

If a license is purchased, the ledger will reflect it.
If terms are accepted, the contract will enforce them.

Nothing more—and nothing less.

This is an open market. The absence of gatekeepers is a feature, not a bug. It enables permissionless participation, global access, and innovation—but it also places responsibility where it belongs: with the participants.

Caveat Emptor.

Protect the ledger.
Question the offer.
Verify before you buy.

The system guarantees integrity of record, not integrity of intent.
