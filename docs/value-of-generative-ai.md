The Decoupling of Process and Artifact: An Economic Analysis of Value in the Age of Generative AI

Working Paper – December 2025

Abstract

The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has fundamentally altered the economics of creative production by collapsing marginal production costs to near zero. This paper contends that the resulting crisis in human creative labor stems not from diminished capability but from profound information asymmetry. Historically, the difficulty of craft served as a reliable proxy for cognitive investment, with process and artifact existing as an inseparable bundle. The technological decoupling of these elements has eliminated traditional market signaling mechanisms that distinguished high-effort human synthesis from low-effort algorithmic generation. Building upon information economics and cultural production theory, this paper introduces a valuation framework centered on “process legibility,” wherein economic value migrates from the commodity of finished outputs to verifiable evidence of iterative refinement, selective rejection, and deliberate judgment. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of economic modeling, sociological theory, and technology studies, it argues that the sustainability of the creative economy depends not on protecting artifacts but on making human creative processes observable and auditable.

1. Introduction

Creative production has long operated on a bundled value proposition wherein artifacts encoded both utility and evidence of cognitive labor. Historically, a painting, manuscript, or architectural design embodied not only a finished product but also a proxy for the effort required to produce it. The difficulty of creation served as an implicit signal of human judgment and investment. However, the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems—such as large language models and image synthesis networks—has disrupted this equilibrium. By reducing marginal production costs toward zero, GenAI has decoupled process from artifact, rendering the latter an unreliable signal of effort or expertise (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2017; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019).

This paper examines how this decoupling creates structural information asymmetries that undermine market valuation of creative labor. When high-quality outputs can be generated instantly and at scale, buyers can no longer infer the level of human input behind artifacts. As a result, traditional pricing mechanisms collapse, and creative professionals face adverse selection pressures similar to those described in Akerlof’s (1970) Market for Lemons.

The central argument advanced here is that economic value is migrating from artifacts to processes—from products to proofs of deliberation. To sustain value creation in an AI-saturated economy, creators and markets must pivot toward systems that make human cognitive labor legible.

2. Literature Review
2.1 Information Asymmetry and Signaling

Akerlof’s (1970) theory of adverse selection demonstrated how asymmetry between observable quality and hidden attributes can cause market failure. Spence (1973) expanded this framework, showing that costly signaling mechanisms—such as education or certification—allow participants to credibly convey value. In creative markets, artifact difficulty historically played that role, functioning as a costly signal of labor and expertise (Stiglitz, 2000).

The introduction of GenAI erodes this mechanism. Since outputs of near-human quality can be generated with negligible effort, the traditional signal collapses. What once served as a credible indicator of skill now carries no informational content.

2.2 Cultural Production and Symbolic Value

Sociological theories of cultural production emphasize that value in art and design arises from institutional and symbolic systems rather than intrinsic properties (Bourdieu, 1993; Becker, 1982). Throsby (2001) conceptualized cultural value as a blend of aesthetic merit and economic utility. However, in the digital age, this symbolic capital has become increasingly mediated by platforms that obscure process and amplify output (Couldry, 2012; Hesmondhalgh, 2019).

The GenAI shift thus represents a crisis in cultural legibility. Where traditional craftsmanship embodied both the artifact and its making, contemporary production often severs that link, reducing creative outputs to fungible data commodities.

2.3 Technological Mediation and Labor Transformation

Digital labor theorists have long warned of the invisibilization of cognitive and affective work (Terranova, 2000; Scholz, 2013). GenAI accelerates this by displacing not labor itself but its visibility. As Marx (1867/1976) noted, value emerges through socially necessary labor time—yet in the AI context, this metric becomes obscured. Consequently, the distinction between human and machine effort collapses in market perception (Autor, 2015; Frey & Osborne, 2017).

3. Theoretical Framework: Process–Artifact Decoupling

The traditional creative economy can be represented as a function where total price 
𝑃
P encodes both utility and cognitive labor:

𝑃
=
𝑓
(
𝑈
out
,
𝐿
cog
,
𝜎
)
P=f(U
out
	​

,L
cog
	​

,σ)

where 
𝑈
out
U
out
	​

 is the utility or aesthetic value of the output, 
𝐿
cog
L
cog
	​

 is the cognitive labor invested, and 
𝜎
σ represents the reliability of the signal linking output to effort. Historically, 
𝜎
≈
1
σ≈1: effort and outcome were tightly correlated.

Generative AI collapses this correlation:

𝜎
AI
→
0
σ
AI
	​

→0

When outputs are indistinguishable in quality regardless of input effort, the market can no longer differentiate between 
𝐿
human
L
human
	​

 and 
𝐿
AI
L
AI
	​

. As in Akerlof’s model, rational buyers default to lower-priced options, driving high-effort producers from the market. This results in the “commodity trap,” wherein human creativity competes directly with near-zero-cost algorithmic generation.

The implication is that the locus of scarcity—and therefore value—must shift. As artifacts lose signaling power, the process of creation itself becomes the new scarce good.

4. Economic Model of Value Migration
4.1 From Artifact Scarcity to Process Scarcity

Let 
𝑉
total
V
total
	​

 denote total creative value:

𝑉
total
=
∑
𝐼
accepted
+
∑
𝐼
rejected
+
𝐽
V
total
	​

=∑I
accepted
	​

+∑I
rejected
	​

+J

where 
𝐼
accepted
I
accepted
	​

 and 
𝐼
rejected
I
rejected
	​

 represent iterations considered during development, and 
𝐽
J represents judgment—the cognitive selection among alternatives.

In human creativity, much of the value lies in negative selection: the deliberate rejection of less effective ideas. AI systems, by contrast, generate additively rather than selectively. Thus, the distinguishing economic variable becomes the presence of evaluative judgment rather than generative capacity.

4.2 The Market for Process Legibility

To correct for information asymmetry, markets must adopt new signaling mechanisms that make cognitive labor observable. This “process legibility” transforms creative offerings from opaque black boxes into transparent “glass box” systems. A legible product can be expressed as:

Product
=
{
𝑂
final
,
𝐻
evolution
,
𝑅
rationale
}
Product={O
final
	​

,H
evolution
	​

,R
rationale
	​

}

where 
𝑂
final
O
final
	​

 is the finished artifact, 
𝐻
evolution
H
evolution
	​

 documents the iterative history, and 
𝑅
rationale
R
rationale
	​

 captures the decision logic.

Such documentation reintroduces a credible commitment device: buyers can once again infer effort through verifiable traces of cognition.

5. Process Legibility in Practice
5.1 Verification Mechanisms

Implementing process legibility requires institutional innovation. Potential mechanisms include:

Version control systems that timestamp creative evolution (analogous to Git repositories).

Decision logs recording evaluative reasoning.

Peer review protocols that assess methodological rigor rather than aesthetic outcome.

Blockchain-based provenance systems ensuring authenticity of process documentation (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016).

These tools collectively reconstitute labor visibility in digital environments, enabling markets to reward intentionality rather than mere output.

5.2 Reframing Human Advantage

The comparative advantage of human creators in the GenAI era lies not in generative ability but in judgment, contextual awareness, and ethical reasoning—qualities that remain computationally elusive (Floridi & Chiriatti, 2020). By making these elements observable, creators can reclaim value within a transparent marketplace of deliberative processes.

6. Implications and Conclusions

Generative AI does not eliminate creative labor; it displaces where that labor’s value is captured. As artifacts approach infinite supply and zero cost, economic value necessarily migrates to the finite dimensions of human judgment and temporal investment. The future of the creative economy thus lies not in defensive protectionism but in architectural redesign of valuation systems.

By adopting standards of process legibility, creative markets can evolve toward an economy of evidence—rewarding transparency, intentionality, and cognitive rigor. This transition aligns with broader economic movements toward verified authenticity and traceable production across industries (Porter & Kramer, 2011).

Ultimately, the survival of professional creativity depends on revealing what AI cannot: the human capacity for deliberate choice, reflective iteration, and meaning-making. In the age of generative automation, our competitive advantage is not in what we produce, but in the demonstrable intelligence of how we produce it.
