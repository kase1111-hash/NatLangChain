Lawful Use & Non-Surveillance Guarantee
Our Commitment

This system is designed to record intent, not monitor people.

We provide neutral infrastructure for posting, matching, negotiating, and closing clearly stated intent in public prose. We do not operate surveillance, conduct investigations, or act as law enforcement.

Our goal is simple: enable lawful alignment in daylight, with receipts.

What We Do
1. Record Explicit Intent

We immutably record what users choose to publish.

Posts are voluntary

Language is user-supplied

Outcomes are explicit

Nothing is inferred beyond what is written.

2. Mediate Clearly Stated Requests

AI mediation is used to:

Clarify meaning

Propose alignment

Summarize terms

Mediation does not judge legality, morality, or character.

3. Preserve Receipts

Negotiations, acceptances, rejections, and closures are recorded so:

Agreements are auditable

Disputes are contextual

Ghosting and ambiguity are minimized

What We Do Not Do

We explicitly do not:

Conduct surveillance or monitoring

Track users across sessions or platforms

Report activity to authorities

Share private data with third parties

Perform covert investigations or stings

Secretly flag, profile, or score users

There are no hidden observers. There are no backchannels.

Integrity Checks (Not Enforcement)

Before an entry is accepted, the system may perform an integrity check to ensure the intent is:

Sufficiently clear

Suitable for permanent public record

Appropriate for mediation on this ledger

If ambiguity or euphemism prevents safe interpretation, the system may respond:

“This intent is not sufficiently clear for mediation. Please clarify or reconsider posting.”

Key principles:

No accusations are made

No legal determinations are issued

No records are created if posting is declined

This is procedural refusal, not enforcement.

Lawful Use Boundary

This ledger is intended for lawful, consensual activity.

We do not intermediate:

Explicitly harmful intent

Deliberately obscured intent

Requests requiring secrecy or deniability

We do not delete speech. We simply decline to mediate unclear or unsafe intent.

Optional Verification (User-Chosen)

Users may attach third-party attestations such as:

Identity verification

Background checks

Professional credentials

Important:

We never store personal documents

We only record proof references

Verification is optional and contextual

Trust is opt-in, not imposed.

Equal Treatment

All participants—individuals, companies, organizations, or public institutions—use the same mechanisms:

Same posting rules

Same mediation

Same visibility

Same receipts

No actor receives hidden powers.

Why This Discourages Abuse

This system favors:

Explicit language

Permanent records

Voluntary participation

Activities that depend on ambiguity, deniability, or ephemerality naturally avoid environments like this.

No policing is required. Clarity does the work.

Our Principle

We do not watch people. We record what people choose to say—clearly, publicly, and by consent.

That is the boundary. That is the guarantee.
