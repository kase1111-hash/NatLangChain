The Art of the Intent: A User Guide
On NatLangChain, your words are your workers. If you write vaguely, the Mediators will ignore you. If you write clearly, the system will fight for you. Follow these four pillars to ensure your intent is mediated with high confidence.

1. The "Signal-to-Noise" Rule
Mediators are programmed to reject "slop" (marketing speak, buzzwords, or filler). They seek Concrete Declarations.
Bad: "I’m a highly motivated individual looking to disrupt the space with innovative solutions." (Result: Marked as Opaque. No Alignment.)
Good: "I have designed a 10-piece visual identity kit for sustainable fashion brands. I want to trade this kit for 300 NLC or a specialized audit of my smart contract." (Result: High-Confidence Match.)
2. The Anatomy of an Intent
Every successful post should contain three specific components, even if they are woven into a story:
Component
Description
Example
The Asset/Need
What do you have or what do you require?
"I have a trained LoRA model for architectural renders."
The Threshold
What is the minimum you will accept?
"I will not accept less than 50 NLC per commercial use."
The "Alignment North"
What kind of world are you trying to build?
"I prefer my work to be used in urban planning projects."

3. Using "Prose Hooks"
Since the Mediators use semantic vectors, specific terminology acts as a "hook" for alignment. Use the precise language of your craft.
For Coders: Mention specific libraries, benchmarks (e.g., "reduced latency by 15ms"), and licensing preferences.
For Writers: Mention tone, word count, and "Right-to-Refuse" clauses for AI training.
For Bounties: State the problem, not just the solution. "I am failing to scale my database past 10k concurrent users" is a better hook than "Need a DB expert."
4. The Constraints (The "No-Go" Zone)
The most powerful way to narrow your alignment is to state what you won't do. This prevents "Bad Alignments" and saves you from the emotional tax of declining deals manually.
Example: "I will not work on projects involving gambling or extractive finance."
Example: "I will not engage in video calls; all mediation must remain on-chain in prose."

5. The "Self-Seeking" Test
Before you post, ask yourself: "If I were a neutral stranger reading this, would I know exactly how to satisfy this person?"
If the answer is "maybe": Your intent is too soft. Add numbers, dates, or specific outcomes.
If the answer is "yes": Post it. The Mediators will do the rest.

Sample Template: The "Professional Branch" Post
[Context: Design/Branding]
Intent: I have produced a set of five high-fidelity UI templates for medical record apps. They are optimized for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AAA).
The Ask: I am looking for 1,000 NLC for a full buyout, OR a revenue-share alignment with a startup in the telehealth space.
Constraint: I require a 'Closed Receipt'—meaning I want my name in the project's 'Credits' file forever.
Status: Seeking Alignment.
