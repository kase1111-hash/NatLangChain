Architectural Premise

NatLangChain: Spine of human-intent recording and settlement.

Agent OS: Locally-controlled agentic OS that assists users under Learning Contracts. Includes internal drift and hallucination regulation (Synth-Mind component).

Mediator Node: Third-party contract mediator for NatLangChain. Uses only LLM models that are loaded or selected by the user.

Other modules: feed, protect, or consume intent/value without replacing human decision-making.

Step 0 — Local Sovereignty & Safety
Agent OS

Root of trust, key ownership, Learning Contracts enforcement.

Optional integration with NatLangChain via companion modules.

Boundary Daemon

Enforces trust boundaries and prevents unauthorized data flow.

Step 1 — Human Intent Declaration
IntentLog

Captures reasoning (“why”) for Alice and Bob’s intents.

NatLangChain

Records final, human-ratified intent (MP-01).

Step 2 — Contract Negotiation
Mediator Node (Third-Party)

Operates independently from participants.

Uses chosen LLMs to propose settlement options.

Highlights conflicts, offers alternative formulations.

Requires explicit negotiation payment in the contract to reward the party who successfully mines the blockchain contract.

Cannot finalize agreements; only proposes.

(Optional) Agent OS

Provides local assistance to participants, ensuring clarity.

Step 3 — Agreement Ratification
NatLangChain

Records explicit human ratifications in natural language.

Closes MP-01; ensures agreements are canonical and auditable.

Step 4 — Proof of Effort
Memory Vault

Stores raw work, logs, transcripts, failed paths.

Value Ledger

Records hashes, timestamps, and meta-value (MP-02).

Step 5 — Licensing & Delegation
NatLangChain

Records human-ratified licenses with scope, duration, transferability (MP-04).

Agent OS Learning Contracts

Governs what agent can observe and learn locally; enforces retention, generalization, and revocation rules.

Step 6 — Delivery & Review
Memory Vault

Stores final delivery artifacts and new receipts.

Boundary Daemon

Enforces boundaries, prevents leakage.

IntentLog

Preserves rationale for updates or clarifications.

Step 7 — Settlement
NatLangChain

Alice declares fulfillment; Bob confirms satisfaction.

Settlement includes negotiation payment to Mediator Node for successfully mined blockchain contract (MP-05).

Step 8 — Capitalization Interface
Value Ledger

Generates structured interface for accounting systems, payment rails, or optional smart contracts.

NatLangChain itself does not move money.

Optional Extensions
RRA-Module

Converts dormant repos into autonomous agents, respecting NatLangChain ratifications.

Finite-Intent-Executor

Executes predefined posthumous or delayed intent per NatLangChain agreements.

Common

Shared schemas, cryptographic primitives, receipt formats, and provenance standards.

One-Sentence Summary (Updated)

NatLangChain records human intent and settlements; Mediator Node mediates contracts as a third-party using user-selected LLM models, earning a negotiation reward for mined agreements; Agent OS enforces Learning Contracts locally; Memory Vault and Value Ledger track effort and value; all modules cooperate without automating human decisions.
